# Intention
This repository is meant to be a timecapsule for relevant genealogy data related to my family in the broadest sense possible. Information about related persons shall be collected here. For the future two use-cases are envisioned: 
* have the data stored in a digital (and redundant) way to pass down to my childen and so on (in the hope that one day they will continue to take care of it)
* make an analog copy of the data (where possible) for long term storage in a lightweight way, e.g. microfilm, etc.

# familyTree
The [familyTree](familyTree) contains mainly the gedcom based family tree [familyTree/my-family-tree.ged](familyTree/my-family-tree.ged). Gedcom is a defacto file standard for genealogy. It can be edited by many open source software such as Gramps [gramps-project.org](gramps-project.org).
Other files that describe a family tree can be added. Its content should be transformed into the main family tree in gedcom format.

# personalMemories
in [personalMemories](personalMemories) any standard file type that is related to persons like text, images, audios or videos that contain information about one or several persons that can be found within the familyTree (gedcom file).
